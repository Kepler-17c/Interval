> Chains of multiplications create larger and larger numbers in ExactDecimal fractions. Growing to
  millions of digits, they will literally freeze the program. An alternate data structure/internal
  format might help.
  One idea is using arrays or maps to count prime factors (easy for multiplication but difficult for
  addition because of factorisation).
